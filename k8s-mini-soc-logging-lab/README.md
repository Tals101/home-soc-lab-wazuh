\# Kubernetes Mini SOC Logging \& Detection Lab



A Kubernetes-focused SOC and detection engineering lab built using Minikube, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana to centralize logs, generate attack telemetry, and create detection-oriented monitoring dashboards.



\---



\# Project Summary



This project demonstrates how centralized logging and detection engineering concepts can be implemented inside a Kubernetes environment.



The lab focused on:

\- centralized log aggregation

\- Kubernetes observability

\- attack telemetry generation

\- SOC dashboard development
