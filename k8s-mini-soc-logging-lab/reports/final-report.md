\# Kubernetes Mini SOC Logging \& Detection Lab



\## Project Summary



This project focused on building a lightweight Kubernetes SOC-style logging and detection environment using Loki, Promtail, and Grafana inside a Minikube Kubernetes cluster.



The objective was to centralize Kubernetes logs, generate attacker telemetry, and build detection-oriented dashboards capable of identifying suspicious activity inside containerized workloads.

whoami

id

```



\### Sensitive File Access



```bash

cat /etc/passwd

```



\### Failed Command Execution



```bash

fakecommand

```



\### Network Activity



```bash

curl http://loki:3100/ready

```

```



\### Failed Command Detection



```logql

{namespace="mini-soc"} |= "not found"

```



\### Sensitive File Access Detection



```logql

{namespace="mini-soc"} |= "passwd"

```
