\# Snort Detection \& Alert Validation



\## Objective

Validate that Snort can detect and generate alerts based on custom rules in a controlled lab environment.



\## Lab Setup

\- Snort installed on Ubuntu Server

\- Interface: enp0s3

\- Local network: 192.168.56.0/24



\## Rule Created

ICMP detection rule:



```text

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

```



\## Traffic Generation

\- Used the `ping` command to generate ICMP traffic

\- Traffic was sent to the Snort machine IP address



\## Detection

\- Snort was run in console mode

\- Alerts triggered immediately when ICMP traffic was received



\## Validation

\- Confirmed the rule loaded correctly

\- Verified alerts matched expected behavior

\- Observed real-time detection in terminal output



\## Outcome

Successfully validated Snort’s ability to:

\- Monitor network traffic

\- Apply custom detection rules

\- Generate real-time alerts



\## Key Takeaways

\- Snort rule syntax is important for accurate detection

\- Proper `snort.conf` configuration is required

\- Controlled traffic testing confirms IDS functionality
