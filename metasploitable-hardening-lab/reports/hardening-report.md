# Metasploitable Hardening Report

## Project Summary

This project focused on identifying and remediating high-risk vulnerabilities on a Metasploitable 2 virtual machine. The objective was to reduce the system's attack surface by disabling insecure and unnecessary services and validating remediation through comparative network scanning.

---

## Scope

- Target System: Metasploitable 2 (192.168.56.115)

- Assessment Type: Vulnerability Identification and Remediation

- Tools Used:

- Nmap

- Manual service inspection

- Command-line service management

---

## Initial Findings (Pre-Remediation)

A network scan revealed multiple high-risk services exposed:

| Port | Service | Risk |

|------|--------|------|

| 21 | FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4) | Known backdoor vulnerability allowing remote root access |

| 23 | Telnet | Transmits credentials in cleartext |

| 445 | SMB (Samba) | Susceptible to enumeration and remote exploitation |

These services significantly increased the attack surface of the system.

---

## Exploitation (Validation of Risk)

The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) was confirmed to be vulnerable to a known backdoor, allowing unauthorized root access to the system.

This demonstrated the severity of the exposure and validated the need for remediation.

---

## Remediation Actions

The following actions were taken to reduce risk:

### 1. Telnet (Port 23)

- Disabled by stopping the associated service (xinetd)

### 2. FTP (Port 21)

- Stopped the vsftpd service

- Disabled service from starting at boot

### 3. SMB (Port 445)

- Terminated Samba processes

- Stopped the Samba service

---

## Post-Remediation Validation

A follow-up scan confirmed that the previously exposed services were no longer accessible:

| Port | Status |

|------|--------|

| 21 | Closed |

| 23 | Closed |

| 445 | Closed |

This demonstrates a measurable reduction in attack surface.

---

## Results

- Successfully eliminated multiple critical vulnerabilities

- Prevented unauthorized remote access vectors

- Reduced externally exposed services

- Improved overall system security posture

---

## Key Takeaways

- Vulnerability identification alone is insufficient without remediation

- High-risk services should be prioritized based on exploitability

- Validation through rescanning is essential to confirm fixes

- Even simple configurations can significantly reduce risk
