# Metasploitable Hardening Lab

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates the identification, exploitation, remediation, and validation of critical vulnerabilities on a deliberately vulnerable Linux system (Metasploitable 2). The goal was to reduce the system's attack surface by targeting high-risk services and validating improvements through comparative network scans.

---

## Why This Project Matters

Many vulnerability assessments stop at detection. This project goes further by:

- Prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities

- Demonstrating real exploitation

- Applying remediation actions

- Validating security improvements

This reflects a real-world vulnerability management workflow rather than simple tool usage.

---

## Objectives

- Identify exposed services using network scanning

- Validate vulnerabilities through exploitation

- Remediate high-risk services

- Confirm fixes through rescanning

---

## Lab Environment

### Target

- Metasploitable 2 (192.168.56.115)

### Attacker

- Kali Linux

### Tools Used

- Nmap

- Netcat

- Linux service management tools

---

## Key Actions Performed

### 1. Enumeration

Performed service discovery using Nmap to identify exposed ports and services.

### 2. Exploitation

Exploited a known backdoor in vsftpd 2.3.4 to gain root access.

### 3. Remediation

Disabled high-risk services:

- Telnet (Port 23)

- FTP (Port 21)

- SMB (Port 445)

### 4. Validation

Re-scanned the system to confirm that services were no longer exposed.

## Results

| Service | Port | Status Before | Status After |

|--------|------|-------------|-------------|

| FTP | 21 | Open | Closed |

| Telnet | 23 | Open | Closed |

| SMB | 445 | Open | Closed |

The system’s attack surface was significantly reduced.


---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Vulnerability identification and prioritization

- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities

- Linux system administration and service management

- Network scanning and validation

- Security remediation workflows

---

## Key Takeaway

Effective security is not just about finding vulnerabilities—it requires remediation and validation to ensure real risk reduction.
