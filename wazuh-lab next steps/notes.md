## 📝 Troubleshooting Notes

### 1. Wazuh Agent Not Connected

**Issue:**

The Windows agent was not appearing in the Wazuh dashboard.

**Cause:**

The agent was installed without specifying the Wazuh manager IP.

**Fix:**

- Manually updated ossec.conf with the correct server IP

- Restarted the Wazuh agent service

- Verified connection using agent\_control -l

---

### 2. No Failed Login Events in Wazuh

**Issue:**

Failed login events (Event ID 4625) were visible in Windows Event Viewer but not in Wazuh.

**Cause:**

Uncertainty around whether Security logs were being collected by the agent.

**Fix:**

- Verified ossec.conf included:

<location>Security</location>

- Restarted the Wazuh agent

- Confirmed ingestion in the Wazuh dashboard

---

### 3. Wazuh Manager Failed to Start

**Issue:**

Wazuh manager failed to restart after adding a custom rule.

**Cause:**

Invalid XML syntax in local\_rules.xml

**Fix:**

- Identified error using:

wazuh-analysisd -t

- Fixed:

- Incorrect XML formatting

- Invalid attributes

- Improper group structure

---

### 4. Incorrect Rule Logic

**Issue:**

Custom rule did not trigger despite multiple failed login attempts.

**Cause:**

Used <if\_sid> instead of <if\_matched\_sid> with frequency/timeframe.

**Fix:**

- Replaced <if\_sid> with <if\_matched\_sid>

- Retested rule with simulated brute-force activity

---

### 5. Invalid XML Attribute Error

**Issue:**

Error: Attribute 'id' has no value

**Cause:**

Malformed XML syntax (id"100002" instead of id="100002")

**Fix:**

- Corrected XML formatting

- Revalidated configuration using test command

---

### 6. Broken Example Rule in Config File

**Issue:**

Wazuh failed due to invalid XML in default/example rule section.

**Cause:**

Improperly formatted <group> tag from example content.

**Fix:**

- Removed broken example rule

- Replaced file with clean, valid XML rule

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Small XML syntax errors can break the entire SIEM

- Always validate rules before restarting services

- Log ingestion must be verified before building detections

- Correlation rules require correct matching logic (if\_matched\_sid)

- Troubleshooting is a critical part of detection engineering

---

## 🚀 What This Demonstrates

This project required:

- Debugging agent connectivity issues

- Validating log ingestion pipelines

- Writing and fixing SIEM detection rules

- Interpreting error logs and system feedback
