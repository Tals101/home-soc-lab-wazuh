🛡️ Brute-Force Detection (Wazuh SIEM Enhancement)

Project Summary



This project builds on an existing home Security Operations Center (SOC) lab by implementing a brute-force detection use case using Wazuh. The focus was on identifying repeated failed Windows authentication attempts and converting raw log data into a meaningful, high-severity security alert through correlation-based detection logic.



Why This Project Matters



This project demonstrates the transition from basic log monitoring to detection engineering. It highlights the ability to analyze authentication events, simulate attack behavior, and create custom SIEM rules that identify suspicious patterns such as brute-force login attempts.



Skills Demonstrated

SIEM Rule Development (Wazuh)

Log Correlation

Alert Tuning

Troubleshooting \& Debugging

Objectives

Detect repeated failed login attempts (Event ID 4625)

Create a custom Wazuh rule for brute-force detection

Simulate brute-force behavior on a Windows endpoint

Validate alert generation in the Wazuh dashboard

Improve signal-to-noise ratio through rule tuning

Lab Environment

Technologies Used

Wazuh

Ubuntu Server

Windows 10/11

VirtualBox

Components

Wazuh Server: Centralized SIEM for log ingestion, correlation, and alerting

Windows Endpoint: Generates authentication logs and telemetry

Wazuh Agent: Collects and forwards Windows Security logs to the SIEM

Setup Steps

Verified Windows Security logs were being ingested into Wazuh

Generated failed login attempts on the Windows endpoint

Identified relevant Wazuh rule for failed authentication (Rule ID 60122)

Created a custom correlation rule in local\_rules.xml

Restarted Wazuh manager and validated configuration

Re-ran attack simulation to trigger detection

Confirmed high-severity alert generation in the dashboard

What I Did

Analyzed Windows Security logs to identify failed authentication events

Simulated brute-force behavior using repeated failed login attempts

Developed a custom Wazuh detection rule using frequency and timeframe conditions

Troubleshot agent connectivity and rule syntax issues

Validated detection accuracy within the Wazuh dashboard

Detection Use Case

Brute-Force Authentication Attempt



Multiple failed login attempts were generated within a short time window to simulate brute-force behavior.



Detection Logic:



Event ID: 4625 (failed login)

Trigger Rule: 60122

Threshold: 5 failed attempts

Timeframe: 60 seconds

Alert Level: 12

Custom Rule

<group name="windows,authentication,bruteforce">

&#x20; <rule id="100002" level="12" frequency="5" timeframe="60">

&#x20;   <if\_matched\_sid>60122</if\_matched\_sid>

&#x20;   <description>Possible brute-force attack: multiple failed logins in 60 seconds</description>

&#x20; </rule>

</group>

Key Outcomes

Successfully detected repeated failed login attempts

Built a correlation-based detection rule in Wazuh

Generated high-severity alerts based on authentication patterns

Validated SIEM detection capability using simulated attack activity

Strengthened understanding of authentication-based threats

Security Relevance



This project demonstrates key blue-team and detection engineering concepts:



Identifying brute-force attack patterns in authentication logs

Correlating multiple low-level events into a high-confidence alert

Enhancing visibility into endpoint authentication activity

Building detection logic within a SIEM platform

Lessons Learned

Learned how to create and validate custom Wazuh rules

Improved understanding of Windows authentication event logging

Gained experience troubleshooting SIEM ingestion and configuration issues

Understood the importance of correlation in reducing alert noise

Saw how repeated low-level events can indicate higher-risk behavior
