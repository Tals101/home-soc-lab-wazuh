# Findings Report — Windows Brute Force Detection Lab

## Executive Summary

This lab demonstrates the detection of a password spraying (brute-force) attack against a Windows system using a Wazuh SIEM.

An attacker machine generated repeated failed authentication attempts against a Windows endpoint. These events were successfully logged, ingested, and detected by the SIEM, validating the effectiveness of the monitoring pipeline.

---

## Objective

* Simulate a brute-force/password spraying attack
* Generate Windows Security Event ID 4625 (failed logon)
* Ingest logs into Wazuh
* Validate detection and alerting

---

## Environment

| Component   | Description                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Attacker    | Kali Linux                 |
| Target      | Windows VM (WIN-LAB-FRESH) |
| SIEM        | Wazuh                      |
| Log Shipper | Filebeat                   |
| Backend     | OpenSearch                 |

## Attack Overview

The attack was executed using CrackMapExec:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.56.113 -u users.txt -p 'Winter2024!'
```

This generated multiple failed login attempts using different usernames.

---

## Detection Details

Wazuh successfully detected the attack using the following rule:

* **Rule ID:** 60122
* **Description:** Logon Failure - Unknown user or bad password
* **Event ID:** 4625

Each failed login attempt generated a corresponding alert.

---

## Key Observations

* Multiple failed login attempts occurred in rapid succession
* The attacker IP (192.168.56.111) was consistently identified
* Different usernames were targeted, consistent with password spraying behavior
* All events were successfully ingested and indexed

---

## Challenges & Resolution

### Issue 1: Agent Not Connecting Properly

* **Cause:** Duplicate agent entries and key conflicts
* **Resolution:** Re-registered agent and removed stale entries

### Issue 2: Logs Not Appearing in Dashboard

* **Cause:** Filebeat authentication failure (401 Unauthorized)
* **Resolution:** Updated Filebeat credentials to match OpenSearch

### Issue 3: Events Not Visible in Dashboard

* **Cause:** Time filter mismatch and index mapping confusion
* **Resolution:** Verified data via OpenSearch and adjusted time filters

---

## Conclusion

The lab successfully demonstrated:

* End-to-end attack simulation
* Log generation and ingestion
* SIEM-based detection
* Alert visualization

This validates the effectiveness of Wazuh in detecting brute-force login attempts in a Windows environment.
