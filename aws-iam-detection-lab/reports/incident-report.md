\# Incident Report: Unauthorized IAM Activity Detection



\## Summary

An unauthorized IAM action was detected involving a low-privileged user attempting to escalate permissions within the AWS environment.



\## Timeline

\- User configured AWS CLI using compromised credentials

\- Attacker enumerated IAM users and permissions

\- Attacker attempted to attach AdministratorAccess policy

\- Action failed with AccessDenied

\- Detection triggered via CloudWatch metric filter

\- Alert generated via CloudWatch alarm

\- Notification received via SNS email



\## Detection Method

Detection was implemented using a CloudWatch Logs metric filter:



`{ $.errorCode = "\*AccessDenied\*" }`



This filter captures failed or unauthorized API calls.



\## Impact

No successful privilege escalation occurred. The activity indicates attempted unauthorized access and privilege escalation.



\## Response

\- Activity was monitored and validated

\- Detection pipeline confirmed functional

\- No remediation required (lab environment)



\## Lessons Learned

\- AccessDenied events are strong indicators of suspicious behavior

\- CloudTrail + CloudWatch can provide effective detection without additional tools

\- Alerting via SNS enables real-time awareness



\## Recommendations

\- Expand detection rules to include:

&#x20; - CreateAccessKey events

&#x20; - Root account usage

\- Implement automated response using AWS Lambda

\- Integrate logs into a centralized SIEM (e.g., Wazuh)
