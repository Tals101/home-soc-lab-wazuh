# Kubernetes Web Security Lab

A multi-phase Kubernetes security lab focused on deployment, misconfiguration exploitation, security auditing, and runtime detection using Minikube, Kubernetes, kube-bench, kube-hunter, and Falco.

---

# Project Summary

This project recreates a vulnerable web application environment inside Kubernetes and progressively introduces offensive and defensive security concepts.

The lab includes:

- vulnerable web applications

- attacker pods

- Kubernetes misconfigurations

- RBAC abuse

- Kubernetes security auditing

- runtime detection tooling

---

# Technologies Used

- Kubernetes

- Minikube

- Docker Desktop

- Helm

- DVWA

- OWASP Juice Shop

- Kali Linux

- kube-bench

- kube-hunter

- Falco

# Project Phases

## Phase 1 — Kubernetes Deployment Lab

### Objectives

- Deploy vulnerable applications into Kubernetes

- Create Kubernetes Services

- Build attacker pods

- Perform internal reconnaissance

### Key Activities

- Deployed DVWA and OWASP Juice Shop

- Created Kubernetes Deployments and Services

- Built Kali attacker pod

- Performed internal service discovery

- Tested pod-to-pod communication

### Skills Demonstrated

- Kubernetes deployments

- Kubernetes networking

- Namespace management

- Internal reconnaissance

- Service discovery

---

## Phase 2 — Kubernetes Misconfiguration Exploitation

### Objectives

- Introduce insecure Kubernetes configurations

- Abuse weak RBAC permissions

- Demonstrate internal attack paths

### Key Activities

- Created root containers

- Exposed NodePort services

- Created vulnerable service accounts

- Performed RBAC abuse and enumeration

### Skills Demonstrated

- Kubernetes securityContext

- RBAC abuse

- Service account misuse

- Kubernetes attack paths

- Internal enumeration

---

## Phase 3 — Kubernetes Security Tooling

### Objectives

- Audit Kubernetes security posture

- Perform active cluster hunting

- Introduce runtime detection

### Tools Used

#### kube-bench

Performed CIS-style Kubernetes hardening checks.

#### kube-hunter

Performed active Kubernetes hunting and identified exposed services and token access risks.

#### Falco

Introduced runtime monitoring and syscall-based container security concepts.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Kubernetes auditing

- Runtime security

- Security monitoring

- Cluster assessment

- Security tooling integration

# Key Takeaways

- Kubernetes introduces unique internal attack surfaces.

- Weak RBAC and exposed services can create serious security risks.

- Runtime security tools help improve visibility into container activity.

- Kubernetes security requires both hardening and monitoring.

- Security tooling complements offensive testing and misconfiguration analysis.
