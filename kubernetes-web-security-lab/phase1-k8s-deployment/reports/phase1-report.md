# Phase 1 — Kubernetes Web Application Deployment Lab

## Project Summary

This phase focused on recreating a vulnerable web application lab inside a Kubernetes environment using Minikube.

The objective was to understand Kubernetes networking, deployments, services, and internal pod communication while preparing the environment for later security testing and exploitation phases.

Applications deployed:

- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

- OWASP Juice Shop

- Kali Linux attacker pod

---

## Objectives

- Deploy vulnerable applications into Kubernetes

- Create Kubernetes Services for application access

- Build an attacker pod inside the cluster

- Test internal Kubernetes networking

- Perform internal reconnaissance from the attacker pod

---

## Environment

### Platform

- Windows 11

- Minikube

- Docker driver

### Applications

- DVWA

- OWASP Juice Shop

- Kali Linux

### Kubernetes Components

- Namespace

- Deployments

- Services

- Pods

---

## Kubernetes Deployments

### DVWA

DVWA was deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment with a NodePort Service exposing the application externally.

### Juice Shop

OWASP Juice Shop was deployed similarly using a Deployment and NodePort Service.

### Kali Attacker Pod

A Kali Linux pod was deployed to simulate an internal attacker performing reconnaissance and application interaction from inside the cluster.

---

## Internal Reconnaissance

### DVWA Recon

nmap dvwa-service.web-security-lab.svc.cluster.local
Result:

- Port 80 identified as open

---

### Juice Shop Recon

nmap juice-service.web-security-lab.svc.cluster.local
Result:

- Port 3000 identified as open

---

## Internal HTTP Access

### DVWA HTTP Access

curl -I http://dvwa-service.web-security-lab.svc.cluster.local
Result:

- HTTP/1.1 302 Found

- Redirected to login page

---

### Juice Shop HTTP Access

curl -I http://juice-service.web-security-lab.svc.cluster.local:3000
Result:

- HTTP/1.1 200 OK

---

## Key Takeaways

- Kubernetes Services enable internal pod-to-pod communication

- Kubernetes DNS allows service discovery using cluster-local names

- Internal reconnaissance inside Kubernetes clusters is straightforward once a pod is compromised

- Attackers inside a cluster can enumerate and communicate with internal applications

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Kubernetes cluster setup

- Kubernetes Deployments

- Kubernetes Services

- Namespace management

- Internal service discovery

- Pod-to-pod communication

- Internal reconnaissance techniques

---

## Conclusion

This phase successfully recreated the vulnerable Docker-based lab environment inside Kubernetes and established the foundation for future Kubernetes security testing and misconfiguration exploitation.
